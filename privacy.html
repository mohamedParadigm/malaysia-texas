                            <p>Texas Chicken® understands the importance of privacy of users of our Online Services. We are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit or use our Online Services. This Children's Privacy Notice is designed to answer your questions regarding our practices with respect to personal information we collect through our Online Services from children under the age of [13].</p>
                            <h4>What Personal Information Does Texas Chicken® Collect?</h4>
                            <p>We offer many features on our Sites, like games and coloring books, which do not require a child to provide any personal information. On occasion, however, we may collect personal information, such as an email address from children as part of an activity. For example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We may collect a child's email address to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstakes. In that event, we will notify the child using the email address the child supplies. We will not keep the email address or use it for any other purpose.</li>
                                <li>We may collect a child's email address in order to respond to a request from the child on a one-time basis, such as to send the child a screen saver. In this case we promptly delete the email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the address for any other purpose.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of [13], such as a [postal address] or telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. If parent or guardian consent is required, we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we can provide notice of our information practices and/or seek the parent's or guardian's consent.</p>
                            <p>Texas Chicken® will not condition a child's participation in any online activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.</p>
                            <h4>How Does Texas Chicken® Use the Personal Information It Collects?</h4>
                            <p>We use email addresses submitted by a child in order to respond to the child's request or to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw, or sweepstakes they entered. We use the email address of a parent or guardian in order to provide the parent notice of our information practices or to seek the parent's or guardian's consent</p>
                            <h4>How Does Texas Chicken® Share Personal Information?</h4>
                            <p>We may share a child's personal information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security or integrity of our Online Services, take precautions against liability, or respond to judicial process or requests from other governmental authorities, or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p>
                            <p>We also may share personal information collected from children with vendors that perform services for Texas Chicken®. These services may include hosting our Sites, providing technical services to Texas Chicken®, fulfilling requests or administering a contest, competition, prize draw, or sweepstakes. We do not authorize such vendors to disclose the personal information we share with them other than as necessary to perform the relevant service for Texas Chicken®.</p>
                            <h4>Requests from Parents Regarding Our Children's Privacy Practices.</h4>
                            <p>Parents may review personal information we have collected from their child that has not been deleted, and can request that the personal information be deleted from our records if it has not been already.
